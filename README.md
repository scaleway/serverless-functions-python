# Serverless Functions Python üíú

Scaleway Serverless Functions is a framework to provide a good developer experience to write Serverless Functions.

Serverless Functions make it easy to deploy, scale, and optimize your workloads on the cloud.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

You can use `pip` to install the framework:

```console
pip install scaleway-functions-python
```

## üì¶ Usage

### üè° Local testing

When working with Serverless functions, it can be hard to test your function without deploying it. The framework provides a utility function that will run your handler locally:

```python
# In handler.py

# Define your Serverless Handler.
def handler(event, _context):
    if event["method"] != "GET":
         return {"statusCode": 405, "body": "Invalid method!"}
    return "Hello World!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # The import is conditional so that you do not need
    # to package the library when deploying on Scaleway Functions.
    from scaleway_functions_python import serve_handler_locally
    serve_handler_locally(handler, port=8080)
```

This adds an entry point to your Python script to run your Serverless handler locally.

```console
$ python handler.py
$ curl http://localhost:8080
> Hello World!
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:8080
> Invalid method!
```

### üß± Type hints

The framework provides some types hints to make it easier to develop your handler. See this [example](examples/mirror.py) for more information on how to use them.
